# TrackIt AI Chat Setup Guide

## ✅ Chat Works Offline & Online!

The TrackIt AI chatbox now works **out of the box** with intelligent fallback responses. When you have a Gemini API key set, it uses real AI. When you don't, it provides smart rule-based responses based on your habit data.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (No Setup Required!)

The chat works immediately! Click the 💬 button and start asking questions:
- "How can I improve my routine?"
- "Give me motivation"
- "How's my progress?"
- "I'm struggling with habits"

You'll get **smart, personalized responses** based on your current habits!

## 🤖 Optional: Use Real Gemini AI (For Better Responses)

Want even smarter AI responses? Add your free Gemini API key:

### Step 1: Get Your Gemini API Key

1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/)
2. Click "Get API Key"
3. Create a new project or use an existing one
4. Click "Create API Key"
5. Copy the API key (looks like a long alphanumeric string)

### Step 2: Add to `.env`

1. Open `.env` in the project root:
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   TRACKIT_SECRET=trackit-dev-secret
   ```

2. Replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual key

3. Save the file

### Step 3: Restart the App

```bash
# Stop: Ctrl+C
# Restart:
python app.py
```

🎉 Now you have **real Gemini AI** responses with full context from your habits!

## 💬 How the Chat Works

### Without API Key (Fallback Mode):
- Detects keywords in your message
- Provides smart, encouraging responses
- Uses your habit data for personalization
- **Always works** - never needs internet for these responses

### With Gemini API Key (AI Mode):
- Sends your message to Google's Gemini model
- AI understands context and habits
- Provides creative, personalized coaching
- Falls back to smart responses if Gemini has issues

## 🎯 Example Conversations

**You:** "How can I improve my routine?"  
**AI:** "Great question! Pick your hardest habit and focus on 3 days in a row. Once you break through, momentum builds itself! 💪"

**You:** "I need motivation"  
**AI:** "You're already here checking on your habits - that's the hardest part! Every single day you show up is a win. Keep crushing it! 🌿"

**You:** "How's my progress?"  
**AI:** "Your Reading is at 100%! Keep that momentum going!"

## ⚙️ Troubleshooting

**Q: Chat says "Network error"?**  
A: Refresh the page. The chat should work even without internet (uses mock responses).

**Q: I set the API key but it's not working?**  
A: 
1. Make sure `.env` file exists in the project root
2. Verify the API key is correct at [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/)
3. Restart the Flask app
4. Check browser console for errors (F12 → Console)

**Q: Is my API key secure?**  
A: 
- ✅ Never sent to the browser - only used server-side
- ✅ `.env` is in `.gitignore` - never committed to Git
- ✅ Safe for development

**Q: Can I disable the AI?**  
A: Yes, just leave `GEMINI_API_KEY` empty. Mock responses still work!
